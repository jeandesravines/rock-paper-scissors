# Paper Rock Scissors

CLI Rock Paper Scissors.

## Install it

```sh
npm install
```

## Try it

```sh
npm start
```

Code is written with ES6, Flow syntax. 
To launch the application Babel is required.  
Under the hood, `npm start` calls `babel-node` to transpiles and execute the code.


## Test it

```sh
npm test
```

Tests are written using Jest.
They currently not cover the CLIs parts.
